              Welcome to HeliSwap, a website-hosted user interface (the &quot;Site&quot;) that we
              provide to allow our users to access the various products, services and information

              under that the risk of loss in trading or holding digital assets of any kind can be
              substantial. As with any asset, the value of digital assets can fluctuate and there
              can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying, selling, holding, or investing
              in digital assets.

              knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as Hedera (HBAR), ether

              acknowledge and accept the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their
              value while they are supplied through the Site, you may suffer loss due to the
              fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool, and experience
              significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can create a token,
              including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent
              projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or
